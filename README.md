# Emoji Tic Tac Toe

## Tech Stack
- React.js (created with Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Emoji Categories
- Animals: 🐶 🐱 🐭 🐰
- Food: 🍕 🍔 🍩 🍟
- Sports: ⚽️ 🏀 🏈 🎾

## Vanishing Feature Implementation
Each player can place a maximum of 3 emojis on the board at a time. When a player places a 4th emoji, the oldest emoji they placed disappears from the board. This is implemented using arrays tracking each player's moves and removing the earliest move before adding the new one.

A small animation highlights the emoji disappearance for better UX.

## Improvements with More Time
- Add sound effects for each move.
- Enhance animations for emoji placement and removal.
- Add a score tracker for multiple rounds.
- Implement a mobile-friendly responsive UI.
- Add AI opponent mode.
